# 📘 DSA Problem Solving Tracker

This repository contains my progress in solving **150+ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems.  
Problems are solved from platforms like **LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit**, and **self-practice**.  
Each topic is organized in separate folders with clean, commented code.
